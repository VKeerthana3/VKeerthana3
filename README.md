## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Keerthana!

I'm passionate about software development, artificial intelligence (AI), and leveraging code to solve problems faced by businesses. As a recent graduate with a Master of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Ontario Tech University, my degree has not only enhanced my technical skills, but also honed my problem-solving, critical thinking, and analytical skills, which are essential to excel in software development roles. 

I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, database management systems, Express.js, and Node.js. My role as a Junior Software Developer at Deighton Associates Limited also honed my competencies in C#, EF Core, unit testing, and debugging. I am now seeking opportunities to grow as a developer and make meaningful contributions by offering innovative solutions.
